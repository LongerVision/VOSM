ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


YAO Wei
Great much thanks are given to Mr. YAO Wei for his help on the following several points:
1) I implemented 1D ASM Profile after I read Mr's YAO Wei's ASMLibrary in 2008.
   So, that's why his name appears as the first author in some functions in the file
   VO_FittingASMNDProfiles.cpp .
2) He helped to dramatically speed up my image warping function, namely,
   function VO_TextureModel::VO_LoadOneTextureFromShape in file VO_TextureModel.cpp .
   That's also why his name is listed as the 2nd author in file VO_TextureModel.cpp .
3) His two fabulous libraries, say ASMLibrary and AAMLibrary partly depend on 
   my old version of statistical models, say, "aambuilding" .
4) He did some further research in statistical models that I'm not familiar with,
   which, I believe, enables him to be one of the best researchers in statistical face models .
